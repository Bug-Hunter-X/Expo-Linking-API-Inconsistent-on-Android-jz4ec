This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  The `Linking.addEventListener` does not trigger consistently, resulting in the app failing to open when a deep link is tapped. This is especially prevalent when the app is not already running. The event listener may register, but never fire.  Debugging is difficult because the listener seems to be correctly set up, yet it's not called.
